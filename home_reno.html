            <i><b>written on august 31st, 2021</b></i><br><br>
            hi everyone and thanks for taking the time to visit my website.<br>
            my understanding of social media these days is that, well, it's<br>
            all about self promotion. i tend to shirk this type of thing.<br>
            nevertheless, i spoke with my partner mary (caitlyn) about how<br>
            it's relatively common for those pursuing a PhD to have one, and<br>
            i needed something to write about. she said write about the home<br>
            renovations, so i guess that's what i'm going to do now.<br><br><br>

            we closed on a small house in the elmhurst neighborhood of<br>
            providence, ri halloween of 2016. i remember it was halloween<br>
            because we were not at all prepared for the onslaught of young<br>
            people coming to our door. i think we ran out of candy in literally<br>
            five minutes and had to turn off the lights/hide. below is the first<br>
            picture i have of the house, a couple days after.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/1.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            looking back at the pictures, apparently the first project we<br>
            undertook was a good old fashioned basement demolition. when they<br>
            build the house, there were a number of diaphragms installed to<br>
            breakup the flow of the basement. more recently than the original<br>
            construction (1930s), someone had built a workout room with drop<br>
            ceiling, faux wood paneling, the whole nine yards. it didn't look<br>
            too hot, to put in gently. no problem, we got rid of the lath &<br>
            horse hair walls. beneath the surface of the workout room, there<br>
            was some very precarious electric wiring and a small bit of<br>
            water damage. goodbye jankiness!<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/2.JPG' width='200px'><img src ='reno_pix/3.JPG' width='200px'><br><br><br>

            the next target was what we now refer to as the mudroom. as a<br>
            house ages, the soil beneath the foundation will move because<br>
            of the water cycle. this will cause the foundation to move.<br>
            at some point, the house settles, as did this one. when the<br>
            inspector looked at the house, he commented on the wood beam<br>
            running the length of the house and said that he's seen three<br>
            family houses sitting on top of a piece of timber like that.<br>
            good for us. it makes sense, too, because the neighborhood<br>
            was predominantly constructed all around the same time, and<br>
            designs were most likely pulled out of a sears catalog or<br>
            something of that nature. the foundation guys probably poured<br>
            a ton of them and then the framers just laid the same timber<br>
            for every foundation. this is just conjecture, but what else<br>
            am i to do seeing as i have not yet perfected my time machine.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/4.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            so yes, the house settled and one byproduct of this was some<br>
            nasty looking cracks in the plaster. i knew nothing of plastering<br>
            prior to the purchase of this home, but i feel relatively confident<br>
            with a taping knife these days. i cut out the plaster that was<br>
            falling out, installed plaster buttons, and then spent probably<br>
            too much time perfecting the tape job. taping as i refer to it<br>
            is just applying progressively thinner coats of joint compound (mud)<br>
            until you can't tell there was ever a crack there.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/5.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            while that was going on, i got some help from my dad adding<br>
            some critical electrical infrastructure. we added a couple<br>
            of switches, a new light, but the major component was addition<br>
            of an exhaust fan to the sole bathroom in the house. i don't<br>
            remember what it was like before, but i'm glad i don't have to<br>
            live that way anymore.<br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/6.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            next up, we had a free tree (sponsored i believe by the city of<br>
            providence) planted in the front yard. looking at pictures from<br>
            before we owned the house, there was a big tree there but it<br>
            fell down. sad.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/7.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            the basement and mudroom projects happened pretty much in tandem,<br>
            along with taking down a tree precariously placed right next to<br>
            our house. it was a small juniper tree. the stump is still there<br>
            if you want to see it.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/8.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            next up was the double living room. both rooms needed a new coat<br>
            of paint. for some reason, i chose a severe blue for the front<br>
            room and a more moderate gray from the farther back room. just<br>
            this past year, we actually went back & repainted the front room<br>
            gray. it looks better, and i'll probably drop a picture later on<br>
            down this post. the ceilings in both of these rooms were<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/9.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            aesthetically impacted by the house settling. we had the idea to<br>
            install shiplap on the ceiling, as well as change the light fixtures<br>
            out for different ones. the ceiling was a big project, but now<br>
            as i sit in one of the very rooms it was installed in, i'm happy<br>
            we spent the time and money to get it together.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/10.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            what i perceive now as probably the most challenging part of the<br>
            renovations was the removal of the flooring in the bathroom. it<br>
            was some kind of stuck on linoleum. now that i think of it, the<br>
            mud room actually had a similar linoleum-esque stuck on tile.<br>
            when you pull the tile off, there are small staples stuck in the<br>
            floor. there's no easy way to get those staples out except some<br>
            good old fashioned time on your knees and a hand tool. i remember<br>
            the bathroom took more than a day for a 10'x5' space and i was<br>
            listening to the album 'skylight' by pinegrove on repeat (please<br>
            don't cancel me).<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/11.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            after removing all of the nails, i replaced the sink, the toilet,<br>
            the light fixtures, and added an outlet. the impetus for this<br>
            entire project was that when one sat down to use the toilet,<br>
            there was less than a foot of spacing between the sink and where<br>
            you sat. the sink was gigantic for some reason. so it had to go.<br>
            there was no outlet in there either, so using a non battery<br>
            powered trimmer or any sort of bathroom appliance was out of the<br>
            question. after that we painted, stained the floor and added a<br>
            new medicine cabinet.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/12.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            the last part of the project was something i used for the basis<br>
            of a class project. i applied a systems engineering methodology<br>
            to the project management, design, construction, and installation<br>
            of a set of shelves. i don't think that the professor was all<br>
            that impressed, but it gave me the opportunity to use some wood<br>
            clamps i had bought on facebook along with the router caitlyn's<br>
            dad gave me when they sold their place in portsmouth. i do not<br>
            unfortunately have the wood shop or man cave of my dreams at<br>
            this point. i would be grateful for even floors in the basement<br>
            at this point. it is what it is and i've tried to make due with<br>
            what i have.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/13.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            looking at the pictures it seems like the next thing we did was<br>
            install a raised bed made out of a reclaimed door. each raised<br>
            bed is made of one door. one cut down the middle, then cut each<br>
            piece in half. i think that's how it goes.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/14.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            somewhere mixed in there, i performed repairs where necessary.<br>
            the washer fill switch broke. the dryer belt broke. the most<br>
            challenging repair was the tub. i had never used pipe dope<br>
            before this project. i had used pipe tape when i installed the<br>
            new sink in the bathroom though. that was a saga. i thought i<br>
            did it correctly, but i remember waking up in the middle of the<br>
            night hearing water running. i hadn't done the plumbing work<br>
            correctly. i've gotten better with that type of work, but i'll<br>
            sub it out if i have my choice.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/15.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            that reminds me of something i probably missed, and it was a<br>
            relatively big one. providence still has a lot of lead lines<br>
            going to the houses. not the mains from the reservoir so much,<br>
            but from the curbstop (where the main meets your house) to the<br>
            house. providence water had a no interest loan thing, so i<br>
            went for it. it's one of the silent improvements that i think<br>
            is worth the expense.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/16.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            the other upkeep project was replacing window panes. the windows<br>
            are original wood, so they use glaze to insulation between the<br>
            sash and the windows. i went back & forth about replacing the<br>
            windows due to the propaganda about lead paint, but i ultimately<br>
            to this point have chosen to keep the windows. we don't slide<br>
            the windows up & down all that often as we use air conditioning,<br>
            so i'm not too pressed about chipping paint. if someone gave<br>
            me a great deal on wood windows, maybe i'd jump. to this point<br>
            i've come across nothing but snake oil salespeople.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/17.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>



            at some point, we painted the office a nice dark gray color. we<br>
            painted the bedroom as well. those were all relatively small<br>
            projects.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/18.PNG' width='200px'>
            <img src ='reno_pix/19.PNG' width='200px'><br><br><br>

            this year has been a big year for projects. we had been kicking<br>
            the can for awhile about painting the kitchen, because it was the<br>
            last part of the house that we hadn't really touched. we painted<br>
            the walls and the cabinetry, only to find that the mismatched<br>
            countertops looked horrible. in a relative windfall, we ordered<br>
            a new much larger sink, bought butcher block countertops, and<br>
            installed them ourselves! i was really worried about the plumbing<br>
            for the sink, but it turned out to be a cinch. fortunately for<br>
            me, the connectors were in good shape and a common size. we also<br>
            installed a new shelf, and around the same time a coat rack for<br>
            the mud room.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/20.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>



            finishing up the interior, we set our sights on exterior projects.<br>
            caitlyn found this app where you get paired up with tree service<br>
            companies that are looking to get rid of their mulch, and they<br>
            drop off a delivery for free. the only catch is that you can<br>
            end up with a ton of mulch. like, way more than you need. she<br>
            signed up, and within twenty-four hours had a delivery in our<br>
            front yard. we didn't own a wheelbarrow at that point, so one<br>
            of us was rolling a yard waste can, and the other one carrying<br>
            a can front the front yard to the back.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/21.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            that rounds up the work that we did predominantly ourselves, but<br>
            not the end of the story. the fence was pretty beat when we moved<br>
            in, and had devolved to a worse place over the duration of our time<br>
            living here. we decided to go through an app and hire someone to<br>
            do that work. they also took down a crummy shed we had.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/22.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>


            the final and probably most apparent part of the renovation started<br>
            with painting of the deck. just before the start of the summer, we<br>
            got it in our heads to finally do something about the circus vibe<br>
            the house had. yellow vinyl, green pink and white paint. it was<br>
            painful to look at every time we got home. we planned to leave the<br>
            vinyl because it was for the most part in good shape, but some pieces<br>
            admittedly became brittle and cracked. we started prep work ourselves<br>
            for the front porch, but realized it was more of a project than we<br>
            wanted to take on ourselves. we hired someone who came out and did<br>
            a first coat on the porch. at the end of the day, we went and looked<br>
            at it and had the same reaction to when we painted the kitchen. the<br>
            new coat of paint made the vinyl look much worse. the painter and i<br>
            looked at what was underneath the vinyl siding. they seemed to think<br>
            that what was underneath was good wood clapboard. we took a peek and<br>
            it was not just good old wood but in mostly great shape. i told them<br>
            to stop working because i wanted to take all of the siding off.<br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/22.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            the next day, a hot saturday, caitlyn and i took down almost all of<br>
            the vinyl siding that could be easily reached by a ladder without<br>
            going near the electrical service wires or out on the roof. the siding<br>
            looked great except for where blow-in insulation was installed. when<br>
            the installers came out, they pulled off the vinyl siding but used<br>
            a hole saw to drill through the wood. it still pains me to think about.<br>
            no big deal, i called up a lumber company and got new cedar clapboard.<br>
            i installed the wood myself without a problem, even the odd angled<br>
            connection points at the edges of the house. i'm still proud of those<br>
            cuts!<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/23.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            we called up the electrical company and had them turn the power off.<br>
            that allowed me to get up near the wires and take the rest of the<br>
            siding down. the same day i did that work, i went up on the roof to<br>
            remove the siding around this little bump-out in the attic. i think<br>
            i must either be afraid of heights, working on a ladder, falling,<br>
            or just have a strong sense of self-preservation. or maybe it's just<br>
            that the pitch of the roof is too severe. whatever it was, being<br>
            up on the roof pulling off siding was a scary but enlightening<br>
            moment for me. i had mentioned to caitlyn that i wanted to put shingles<br>
            on the bump out as kind of an accent. i wanted to do the same for the<br>
            upper rear of the house as well, near the eaves. when we removed the<br>
            siding from the bump out, it turned out that there were in fact<br>
            shingles! this confirmed my idea, and it also made me realize that i<br>
            was going to need to call for help. i ended up hiring a contractor<br>
            out of newport who had a couple free weeks. he and a small crew prepped,<br>
            removed the old shingles, installed new shingles, added new trim around<br>
            the windows, and painted the entire house. we think it looks great.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/24.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            that brings us up to today. yesterday we finally got another load of<br>
            mulch. it was mu(l)ch more than the first go around. haha, that was<br>
            a landscaping joke. laugh with me please...<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/25.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            we have been tossing around the idea of an hvac system. big picture,<br>
            we've considered remodeling the basement or adding a second floor.<br>
            installing air conditioners every year is a pain and they're ugly.<br>
            both projects are larger ticket projects. we've also considered<br>
            moving. being in a place of flux is something i've had to get used<br>
            to. smaller picture, we'd like to change out the backyard lights<br>
            and add an outdoor outlet in the front. we'd like a fancy doorbell,<br>
            too. maybe soon!<br><br><br>

            that pretty much wraps things up here. i should mention that aside<br>
            from caitlyn and maxwell (the dog), we added a cat (margot) and<br>
            another dog (millie) to the squad. we have fun. if you made it this<br>
            far and you aren't a family member, thanks. i hope it wasn't too<br>
            painful. idk if i'll go back and check for typos. i wrote this in<br>
            text edit and now i have to go format it for a website. i've been<br>
            trying to figure out how to host my own blog using open source<br>
            software. i want to use a specific infrastructure but i'm running<br>
            into a brick wall. hope all is well with you wherever you are.<br>
