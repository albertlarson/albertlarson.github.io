            <i><b>written on august 31st, 2021</b></i><br><br>
            hi everyone and thanks for taking the time to visit my website.
            my understanding of social media these days is that, well, it's
            all about self promotion. i tend to shirk this type of thing.
            nevertheless, i spoke with my partner mary (caitlyn) about how
            it's relatively common for those pursuing a PhD to have one, and
            i needed something to write about. she said write about the home
            renovations, so i guess that's what i'm going to do now.<br><br><br>

            we closed on a small house in the elmhurst neighborhood of
            providence, ri halloween of 2016. i remember it was halloween
            because we were not at all prepared for the onslaught of young
            people coming to our door. i think we ran out of candy in literally
            five minutes and had to turn off the lights/hide. below is the first
            picture i have of the house, a couple days after.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/1.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            looking back at the pictures, apparently the first project we
            undertook was a good old fashioned basement demolition. when they
            build the house, there were a number of diaphragms installed to
            breakup the flow of the basement. more recently than the original
            construction (1930s), someone had built a workout room with drop
            ceiling, faux wood paneling, the whole nine yards. it didn't look
            too hot, to put in gently. no problem, we got rid of the lath &
            horse hair walls. beneath the surface of the workout room, there
            was some very precarious electric wiring and a small bit of
            water damage. goodbye jankiness!<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/2.JPG' width='200px'><img src ='reno_pix/3.JPG' width='200px'><br><br><br>

            the next target was what we now refer to as the mudroom. as a
            house ages, the soil beneath the foundation will move because
            of the water cycle. this will cause the foundation to move.
            at some point, the house settles, as did this one. when the
            inspector looked at the house, he commented on the wood beam
            running the length of the house and said that he's seen three
            family houses sitting on top of a piece of timber like that.
            good for us. it makes sense, too, because the neighborhood
            was predominantly constructed all around the same time, and
            designs were most likely pulled out of a sears catalog or
            something of that nature. the foundation guys probably poured
            a ton of them and then the framers just laid the same timber
            for every foundation. this is just conjecture, but what else
            am i to do seeing as i have not yet perfected my time machine.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/4.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            so yes, the house settled and one byproduct of this was some
            nasty looking cracks in the plaster. i knew nothing of plastering
            prior to the purchase of this home, but i feel relatively confident
            with a taping knife these days. i cut out the plaster that was
            falling out, installed plaster buttons, and then spent probably
            too much time perfecting the tape job. taping as i refer to it
            is just applying progressively thinner coats of joint compound (mud)
            until you can't tell there was ever a crack there.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/5.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            while that was going on, i got some help from my dad adding
            some critical electrical infrastructure. we added a couple
            of switches, a new light, but the major component was addition
            of an exhaust fan to the sole bathroom in the house. i don't
            remember what it was like before, but i'm glad i don't have to
            live that way anymore.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/6.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            next up, we had a free tree (sponsored i believe by the city of
            providence) planted in the front yard. looking at pictures from
            before we owned the house, there was a big tree there but it
            fell down. sad.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/7.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            the basement and mudroom projects happened pretty much in tandem,
            along with taking down a tree precariously placed right next to
            our house. it was a small juniper tree. the stump is still there
            if you want to see it.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/8.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            next up was the double living room. both rooms needed a new coat
            of paint. for some reason, i chose a severe blue for the front
            room and a more moderate gray from the farther back room. just
            this past year, we actually went back & repainted the front room
            gray. it looks better, and i'll probably drop a picture later on
            down this post. the ceilings in both of these rooms were<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/9.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            aesthetically impacted by the house settling. we had the idea to
            install shiplap on the ceiling, as well as change the light fixtures
            out for different ones. the ceiling was a big project, but now
            as i sit in one of the very rooms it was installed in, i'm happy
            we spent the time and money to get it together.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/10.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            what i perceive now as probably the most challenging part of the
            renovations was the removal of the flooring in the bathroom. it
            was some kind of stuck on linoleum. now that i think of it, the
            mud room actually had a similar linoleum-esque stuck on tile.
            when you pull the tile off, there are small staples stuck in the
            floor. there's no easy way to get those staples out except some
            good old fashioned time on your knees and a hand tool. i remember
            the bathroom took more than a day for a 10'x5' space and i was
            listening to the album 'skylight' by pinegrove on repeat (please
            don't cancel me).<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/11.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            after removing all of the nails, i replaced the sink, the toilet,
            the light fixtures, and added an outlet. the impetus for this
            entire project was that when one sat down to use the toilet,
            there was less than a foot of spacing between the sink and where
            you sat. the sink was gigantic for some reason. so it had to go.
            there was no outlet in there either, so using a non battery
            powered trimmer or any sort of bathroom appliance was out of the
            question. after that we painted, stained the floor and added a
            new medicine cabinet.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/12.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            the last part of the project was something i used for the basis
            of a class project. i applied a systems engineering methodology
            to the project management, design, construction, and installation
            of a set of shelves. i don't think that the professor was all
            that impressed, but it gave me the opportunity to use some wood
            clamps i had bought on facebook along with the router caitlyn's
            dad gave me when they sold their place in portsmouth. i do not
            unfortunately have the wood shop or man cave of my dreams at
            this point. i would be grateful for even floors in the basement
            at this point. it is what it is and i've tried to make due with
            what i have.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/13.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            looking at the pictures it seems like the next thing we did was
            install a raised bed made out of a reclaimed door. each raised
            bed is made of one door. one cut down the middle, then cut each
            piece in half. i think that's how it goes.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/14.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            somewhere mixed in there, i performed repairs where necessary.
            the washer fill switch broke. the dryer belt broke. the most
            challenging repair was the tub. i had never used pipe dope
            before this project. i had used pipe tape when i installed the
            new sink in the bathroom though. that was a saga. i thought i
            did it correctly, but i remember waking up in the middle of the
            night hearing water running. i hadn't done the plumbing work
            correctly. i've gotten better with that type of work, but i'll
            sub it out if i have my choice.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/15.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            that reminds me of something i probably missed, and it was a
            relatively big one. providence still has a lot of lead lines
            going to the houses. not the mains from the reservoir so much,
            but from the curbstop (where the main meets your house) to the
            house. providence water had a no interest loan thing, so i
            went for it. it's one of the silent improvements that i think
            is worth the expense.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/16.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            the other upkeep project was replacing window panes. the windows
            are original wood, so they use glaze to insulation between the
            sash and the windows. i went back & forth about replacing the
            windows due to the propaganda about lead paint, but i ultimately
            to this point have chosen to keep the windows. we don't slide
            the windows up & down all that often as we use air conditioning,
            so i'm not too pressed about chipping paint. if someone gave
            me a great deal on wood windows, maybe i'd jump. to this point
            i've come across nothing but snake oil salespeople.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/17.JPG' width='400px'><br><br><br>



            at some point, we painted the office a nice dark gray color. we
            painted the bedroom as well. those were all relatively small
            projects.<br><br><br>
            <center><img src ='reno_pix/18.PNG' width='150px'>
            <img src ='reno_pix/19.PNG' width='150px'><br><br><br></center>

            this year has been a big year for projects. we had been kicking
            the can for awhile about painting the kitchen, because it was the
            last part of the house that we hadn't really touched. we painted
            the walls and the cabinetry, only to find that the mismatched
            countertops looked horrible. in a relative windfall, we ordered
            a new much larger sink, bought butcher block countertops, and
            installed them ourselves! i was really worried about the plumbing
            for the sink, but it turned out to be a cinch. fortunately for
            me, the connectors were in good shape and a common size. we also
            installed a new shelf, and around the same time a coat rack for
            the mud room.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/20.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>



            finishing up the interior, we set our sights on exterior projects.
            caitlyn found this app where you get paired up with tree service
            companies that are looking to get rid of their mulch, and they
            drop off a delivery for free. the only catch is that you can
            end up with a ton of mulch. like, way more than you need. she
            signed up, and within twenty-four hours had a delivery in our
            front yard. we didn't own a wheelbarrow at that point, so one
            of us was rolling a yard waste can, and the other one carrying
            a can front the front yard to the back.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/21.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            that rounds up the work that we did predominantly ourselves, but
            not the end of the story. the fence was pretty beat when we moved
            in, and had devolved to a worse place over the duration of our time
            living here. we decided to go through an app and hire someone to
            do that work. they also took down a crummy shed we had.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/24.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>


            the final and probably most apparent part of the renovation started
            with painting of the deck. just before the start of the summer, we
            got it in our heads to finally do something about the circus vibe
            the house had. yellow vinyl, green pink and white paint. it was
            painful to look at every time we got home. we planned to leave the
            vinyl because it was for the most part in good shape, but some pieces
            admittedly became brittle and cracked. we started prep work ourselves
            for the front porch, but realized it was more of a project than we
            wanted to take on ourselves. we hired someone who came out and did
            a first coat on the porch. at the end of the day, we went and looked
            at it and had the same reaction to when we painted the kitchen. the
            new coat of paint made the vinyl look much worse. the painter and i
            looked at what was underneath the vinyl siding. they seemed to think
            that what was underneath was good wood clapboard. we took a peek and
            it was not just good old wood but in mostly great shape. i told them
            to stop working because i wanted to take all of the siding off.<br><br><br>

            the next day, a hot saturday, caitlyn and i took down almost all of
            the vinyl siding that could be easily reached by a ladder without
            going near the electrical service wires or out on the roof. the siding
            looked great except for where blow-in insulation was installed. when
            the installers came out, they pulled off the vinyl siding but used
            a hole saw to drill through the wood. it still pains me to think about.
            no big deal, i called up a lumber company and got new cedar clapboard.
            i installed the wood myself without a problem, even the odd angled
            connection points at the edges of the house. i'm still proud of those
            cuts!<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/23.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            we called up the electrical company and had them turn the power off.
            that allowed me to get up near the wires and take the rest of the
            siding down. the same day i did that work, i went up on the roof to
            remove the siding around this little bump-out in the attic. i think
            i must either be afraid of heights, working on a ladder, falling,
            or just have a strong sense of self-preservation. or maybe it's just
            that the pitch of the roof is too severe. whatever it was, being
            up on the roof pulling off siding was a scary but enlightening
            moment for me. i had mentioned to caitlyn that i wanted to put shingles
            on the bump out as kind of an accent. i wanted to do the same for the
            upper rear of the house as well, near the eaves. when we removed the
            siding from the bump out, it turned out that there were in fact
            shingles! this confirmed my idea, and it also made me realize that i
            was going to need to call for help. i ended up hiring a contractor
            out of newport who had a couple free weeks. he and a small crew prepped,
            removed the old shingles, installed new shingles, added new trim around
            the windows, and painted the entire house. we think it looks great.<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/22.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            that brings us up to today. yesterday we finally got another load of
            mulch. it was mu(l)ch more than the first go around. haha, that was
            a landscaping joke. laugh with me please...<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/25.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            we have been tossing around the idea of an hvac system. big picture,
            we've considered remodeling the basement or adding a second floor.
            installing air conditioners every year is a pain and they're ugly.
            both projects are larger ticket projects. we've also considered
            to. smaller picture, we'd like to change out the backyard lights
            and add an outdoor outlet in the front. we'd like a fancy doorbell,
            too. maybe soon!<br><br><br>
            <img src ='reno_pix/26.PNG' width='400px'><br><br><br>

            that pretty much wraps things up here. i should mention that aside
            from caitlyn and maxwell (the dog), we added a cat (margot) and
            another dog (millie) to the squad. we have fun. if you made it this
            far and you aren't a family member, thanks. i hope it wasn't too
            painful. idk if i'll go back and check for typos. i wrote this in
            text edit and now i have to go format it for a website. i've been
            trying to figure out how to host my own blog using open source
            software. i want to use a specific infrastructure but i'm running
            into a brick wall. hope all is well with you wherever you are.<br><br><br>
